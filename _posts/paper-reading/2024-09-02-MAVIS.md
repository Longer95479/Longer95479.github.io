多相机系统的好处是，更大的FOV，对环境的全向观测，提高定位精度和弱纹理场景下的鲁棒性。
坏处则是更多的传感器带来了更多的计算消耗。The proper handling of measurements
from all cameras is crucial for balancing accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

 [14] extended ORB-SLAM2 [15] to multi-camera
setups, supporting various rigidly coupled multi-camera
systems. [16] introduced an adaptive SLAM system design for arbitrary multi-camera setups, requiring no sensorspecific tuning. Several works [17]–[21] focus on utilizing
a surround-view camera system, often with multiple nonoverlapping monocular cameras, or specializing in motion
estimation for ground vehicles. While demonstrating advantages in robustness in complex environments, these methods
exhibit limited performance in highly dynamic scenarios and
minor accuracy improvements in real-world experiments.


Inspired by [22] and [9], we
employ a localization strategy based on a local map, utilizing
2D extracted features and local 3D map points for precise
pose estimation
