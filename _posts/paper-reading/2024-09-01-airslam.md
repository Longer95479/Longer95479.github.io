First, feature detection
and tracking often fail due to drastic changes or low light,
severely affecting the quality of the estimated trajectory [6],
[7]. 


The
proposed system is a hybrid system as we need the robustness of
data-driven approaches and the accuracy of geometric methods.


Consequently, we aim to design an efficient unified
model that can detect keypoints and line features concurrently
However, achieving a unified model for keypoint and line detection is challenging, as these tasks typically require different
real-image datasets and training procedures.

It is important to note
that in this paper, the term “line detection” refers specifically
to the wireframe parsing task.


In the first round, only the backbone and the keypoint
detection module are trained, which means we need to train a
keypoint detection network.
In the second round, the backbone
and the keypoint detection module are fixed, and we only train
the line detection module on the Wireframe dataset.


We use LightGlue [26] to match keypoints
